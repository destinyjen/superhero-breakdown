    <h1>Destiny's Take on Superheroes</h1>

    <hr>
    <h2>What is a Superhero?</h2>
    <p>A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that typically possesses superpowers, abilities beyond those of
        ordinary people, and fits the role of the hero, typically using their powers to help the world become a better
        place, or dedicating themselves to protecting the public and fighting crime. Superhero fiction is the genre of
        fiction that is centered on such characters,[1] especially, since the 1930s, in American comic books (and later
        in
        Hollywood films, film serials, television and video games), as well as in Japanese media (including kamishibai,
        tokusatsu, manga, anime and video games).

        Superheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins. Some superheroes (for example, Batman
        and
        Iron Man) derive their status from advanced technology they create and use, while others (such as Superman and
        Spider-Man) possess non-human or superhuman biology or use and practice magic to achieve their abilities (such
        as
        Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange).[2][3][4] The Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure,
        especially
        in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[5]
        and
        the Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman
        powers;
        also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person."[6] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed
        adventurers
        or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly
        referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.

        Some superheroes use their powers to help fight daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from
        supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the
        superhero's archenemy or nemesis. Some popular supervillains become recurring characters in their own right.</p>

    <h2>Here is my top 5 list of Superheroes:</h2>

            <h3>Batman</h3>

            <p>Batman[a] is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was

                on
                March
                30, 1939. In the DC Universe continuity, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy,
                philanthropist, and industrialist who resides in Gotham City. Batman's origin story features him
                swearing
                vengeance
                against criminals after witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta
                tempered
                with
                the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona,
                and
                monitors
                the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other creators accompanied Batman with supporting
                characters,
                including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred Pennyworth, James Gordon, and Catwoman; and
                foes such
                as
                the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his archenemy, the Joker.
